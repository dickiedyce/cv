Summary
-------

Through a first-hand practical understanding of successful business practice, and an academic grounding in computing science, I have provided essential process development, implementation, and refinement to enterprise and SME clients,in a variety of business spheres, from multi-national oil field service companies to steroid research suppliers, national magazine publishers to international property groups.

 I'm familiar with a wide range of development tools and cross-platform environments: from shell scripting, through compiler-based, and off-the-shelf applications. I have developed mission critical applications on LAMP stacks (MySQL, PHP, Javascript), using database products (FileMaker, Access), rapid application development tools (AppleScript studio, VBA). I am a quick-study, and enjoy the challenge of a new language/environment.  I have a broad range of personal interests - music, languages, history, philosophy, maker electronics, personal fabrication, and crime fiction.
