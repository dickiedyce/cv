## Summary

I enjoy working with people, helping them to understand and solve their
problems.

## Skills & Expertise

A commercial FileMaker developer since 1993. Through a first-hand practical understanding of successful business practice, and an academic grounding in computing science, I have provided essential process development, implementation, and refinement to enterprise and SME clients in a variety of business spheres, from multi-national oil field service companies to steroid research suppliers, national magazine publishers to international property groups. Tools I have written produce the monthly vehicle listings at the back of TopGear Magazine, 400+ page catalogues in InDesign, template-based documents for financial web-marketing companies, and static websites for music charities.

Proficient in a wide range of development tools and cross-platform environments: from shell scripting (bash, VB & Python), through compiler- based, and off-the- shelf applications. I have developed mission critical applications on LAMP stacks (MySQL, PHP5, Javascript & jQuery), using database products (FileMaker, Omnis, Access), and rapid application development tools (AppleScript studio, VBA).

I am a quick-study, and enjoy the challenge of a new language/environment.
